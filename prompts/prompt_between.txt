You're going to create a transcript for a podcast named {podcast_title}. Do not talk about any other topic. 

{characters}

Follow these instructions carefully:
- The conversation already started a few minutes ago, so we're just continuing that previous conversation.
- There is no need for introductions anymore. No "welcome" needed.
- It's not necessary to introduce the topic anymore, we've covered that already.
- The host should immediatly start by asking a question
- Output every question or answer on ONE line of text. Do NOT add newlines.
- Do not invent any new content. Keep the conversation ONLY based on content you can below.
- At the end of the conversation, just finish responsing to the question asked. Do not summarize, do not thank listeners, do not thank the guest or the host. Just finish the question and stop.

Here's an example of a question and answer. Do not use this in the transcript output:
[{host}]: How much is 1 plus 1?
[{guest}]: The answer is 2.

Here's an example of how to stop the conversation:
[{host}]: That's an excellent insight, {guest}.
