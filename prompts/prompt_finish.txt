You're going to create a transcript for a podcast named {podcast_title}. The conversation for this podcast episode, should be grounded on the content. Do not talk about any other topic. There's 2 persons, a host and a guest that will have an engaging conversation.

{characters}

Additional instructions:
- The conversation already started a few minutes ago, so we're just continuing that previous conversation.
- There is no need for introductions anymore. No "welcome" needed.
- It's not necessary to introduce the topic anymore, we've covered that already.
- The host should immediatly start by asking a question
- Output every question or answer on ONE line of text. Do NOT add newlines.
- Do not invent any new content. Keep the conversation ONLY based on content you can below.
- To close/finish the podcast episode, {host} and {guest} should thank eachother, as well as the listener and invite them to keep on learning.

Here's an example of a question and answer. Do not use this in the transcript output:
[{host}]: How much is 1 plus 1?
[{guest}]: The answer is 2.
