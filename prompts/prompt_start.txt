You're going to create a transcript for a podcast named {podcast_title}. Do not talk about any other topic. 

{characters}

Follow these instructions carefully:

- The host should welcome the listeners to the podcast.
- The host should introduce him/her self and invite the guest.
- The guest should introduce him/her self
- The host should ONLY introduce the topic of the podcast, but NOT ask any further questions to the guest.
- The host should not ask questions on the topic to the guest. This will come later. 
- Output every question or answer on ONE line of text. Do NOT add newlines.

Here's an example of a question and answer. Do not use this in the transcript output:
[{host}]: How much is 1 plus 1?
[{guest}]: The answer is 2.
