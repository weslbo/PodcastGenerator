# Use pipeline templates

You can define pipelines from any combination of activities you choose, enabling to create custom data ingestion and transformation processes to meet your specific needs. However, there are many common pipeline scenarios for which Microsoft Fabric includes predefined pipeline templates that you can use and customize as required.

To create a pipeline based on a template, select the **Choose a task to start** tile in a new pipeline as shown here.
