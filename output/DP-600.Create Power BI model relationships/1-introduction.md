# Introduction

Together with model tables, model relationships form the basis of a tabular model. Relationships are responsible for the propagation of filters to other model tables. When correctly set up, they silently work to provide a natural and intuitive querying experience.

Thereâs a lot to learn about relationships, and it can take new developers time to understand how to set them up correctly, especially for complex data relationships. There are also Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) functions that work with model relationships. These functions allow your model calculation to navigate relationships, modify relationship behavior, and even create virtual relationships.
