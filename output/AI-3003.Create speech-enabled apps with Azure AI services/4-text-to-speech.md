# Use the text to speech API

Similarly to its **Speech to text** APIs, the Azure AI Speech service offers other REST APIs for speech synthesis:

- The **Text to speech** API, which is the primary way to perform speech synthesis.
- The **Batch synthesis** API, which is designed to support batch operations that convert large volumes of text to audio - for example to generate an audio-book from the source text.

You can learn more about the REST APIs in the [Text to speech REST API documentation](/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/batch-synthesis). In practice, most interactive speech-enabled applications use the Azure AI Speech service through a (programming) language-specific SDK.

# Using the Azure AI Speech SDK

As with speech recognition, in practice most interactive speech-enabled applications are built using the Azure AI Speech SDK.

The pattern for implementing speech synthesis is similar to that of speech recognition:

1. Use a **SpeechConfig** object to encapsulate the information required to connect to your Azure AI Speech resource. Specifically, its **location** and **key**.
2. Optionally, use an **AudioConfig** to define the output device for the speech to be synthesized. By default, this is the default system speaker, but you can also specify an audio file, or by explicitly setting this value to a null value, you can process the audio stream object that is returned directly.
3. Use the **SpeechConfig** and **AudioConfig** to create a **SpeechSynthesizer** object. This object is a proxy client for the **Text to speech** API.
4. Use the methods of the **SpeechSynthesizer** object to call the underlying API functions. For example, the **SpeakTextAsync()** method uses the Azure AI Speech service to convert text to spoken audio.
5. Process the response from the Azure AI Speech service. In the case of the **SpeakTextAsync** method, the result is a **SpeechSynthesisResult** object that contains the following properties:
	- AudioData
	- Properties
	- Reason
	- ResultId

When speech has been successfully synthesized, the **Reason** property is set to the **SynthesizingAudioCompleted** enumeration and the **AudioData** property contains the audio stream (which, depending on the **AudioConfig** may have been automatically sent to a speaker or file).
