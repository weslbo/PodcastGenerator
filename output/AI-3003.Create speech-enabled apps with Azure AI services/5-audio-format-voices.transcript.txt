[Brian]: So Emma, I've been reading about configuring audio format and voices in Azure AI Speech service. Can you tell me more about it?

[Emma]: Sure, Brian. When synthesizing speech, you can customize the audio format that is returned by the Azure AI Speech service. You have the option to choose the audio file type, sample rate, and bit depth based on your specific needs.

[Brian]: That's interesting. Can you give me an example of how to specify the output format?

[Emma]: Absolutely. To specify the output format, you can use the SetSpeechSynthesisOutputFormat method of the SpeechConfig object. For example, you can set it to SpeechSynthesisOutputFormat.Riff16Khz16BitMonoPcm to get a 16kHz, 16-bit mono PCM audio file.

[Brian]: I see. And what about the voices? How can I personalize my speech-enabled applications?

[Emma]: The Azure AI Speech service provides multiple voices that you can use. There are standard voices, which are synthetic voices created from audio samples, and neural voices, which are more natural sounding voices created using deep neural networks.

[Brian]: That's great. How do I specify a voice for speech synthesis?

[Emma]: To specify a voice, you can set the SpeechSynthesisVoiceName property of the SpeechConfig object to the voice you want to use. For example, you can set it to "en-US-AriaNeural" to use the neural voice named Aria for English (United States).

[Brian]: Got it. So I can choose the output format and voice that best suit my application's needs.

[Emma]: Exactly, Brian. By customizing the audio format and selecting the appropriate voice, you can create a more personalized and natural speech experience for your users.

[Brian]: That's an excellent insight, Emma. Thank you for explaining how to configure audio format and voices in Azure AI Speech service.

[Emma]: You're welcome, Brian. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
