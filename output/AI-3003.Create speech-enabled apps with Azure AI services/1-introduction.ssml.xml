Today, we'll be focusing on Azure AI Speech, which provides a range of APIs for speech-enabled applications. These APIs include speech to text, text to speech, speech translation, speaker recognition, and intent recognition. We'll be specifically looking at speech recognition and speech synthesis, which are essential for any speech-enabled application.

Throughout this module, we'll cover how to provision an Azure resource for the Azure AI Speech service, how to use the Speech to text API for speech recognition, how to use the Text to speech API for speech synthesis, and how to configure audio format and voices. We'll also touch on Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).
