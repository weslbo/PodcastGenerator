Thanks for joining us, Emma. Today, we're going to dive into the topic of time intelligence in analytics solutions. Time intelligence is all about calculations over dates and time. It's a crucial aspect of data analysis expressions (DAX) calculations. Emma, could you tell us more about time intelligence and how it relates to analytics solutions?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Absolutely, Brian. Time intelligence in analytics solutions involves modifying the filter context for date filters. It allows us to perform calculations over dates, months, quarters, or years. For example, we can calculate year-to-date revenue or compare revenue for the same period last year. Time intelligence measures help answer important time-related questions in analytics.

That's fascinating, Emma. I can see how time intelligence measures can provide valuable insights into business performance over time. I'm really excited to learn more about how to create these measures.
