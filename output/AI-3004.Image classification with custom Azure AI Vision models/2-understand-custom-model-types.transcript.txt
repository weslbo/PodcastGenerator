[Brian]: So Andrew, I've been reading about the different types of custom models in Azure AI Vision. Can you explain to me the differences between image classification, object detection, and product recognition?

[Andrew]: Sure, Brian. Image classification is when a model is trained to predict a label for an image based on its contents. It's like identifying the main subject of the image. For example, you can train a model to classify images of fruits as apples, bananas, or oranges.

[Brian]: Ah, I see. So it's about predicting the label for the entire image. Can image classification models handle multiple classes?

[Andrew]: Absolutely, Brian. Image classification models can be trained for multi-class classification, where an image can belong to only one class. But they can also be trained for multi-label classification, where an image can be associated with multiple labels.

[Brian]: That's interesting. Now, let's talk about object detection. How does it differ from image classification?

[Andrew]: Object detection is about detecting the presence and location of one or more classes of objects in an image. It's like identifying the type and location of items in a grocery store checkout system. The model not only predicts the class label of each object but also provides the coordinates of a bounding box that encloses the object.

[Brian]: Ah, I get it. So object detection is more detailed, providing both the class label and the location of the objects. Now, what about product recognition? How is it different from object detection?

[Andrew]: Product recognition is similar to object detection, but it's specifically designed for improved accuracy in recognizing product labels and brand names. It provides predictions with both the class label and the location of the product in the image. This can be useful for applications like inventory management or visual search.

[Brian]: Got it. So product recognition is like a specialized version of object detection that focuses on accurately recognizing product labels and brands. Thanks for explaining that, Andrew.

[Andrew]: You're welcome, Brian. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
