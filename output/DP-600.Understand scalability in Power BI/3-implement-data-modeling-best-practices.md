# Implement Power BI data modeling best practices

Implementing data modeling best practices is key to performant, scalable data models.

## 
# Choose the correct Power BI model framework

Choosing the correct Power BI model framework is at the heart of building any scalable solution.

The first place to start with your Power BI data model is [*import mode*](/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-dataset-modes-understand#import-mode). Import mode offers you the most options, design flexibility, and delivers fast performance.

Use [*DirectQuery*](/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-dataset-modes-understand#directquery-mode) when your data source stores large volumes of data and/or your report needs to deliver near real-time data.

Finally, use a [*composite model*](/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-dataset-modes-understand#composite-mode) when you need to:

- Boost the query performance of a DirectQuery model.
- Deliver near real-time query results from an import model.
- Extend a Power BI dataset (or Azure Analysis Services model) with other data.

Composite models combine data from more than one DirectQuery source or combine DirectQuery with import data.

Important

Review the [Choose a Power BI model framework](/en-us/training/modules/choose-power-bi-model-framework/) module for more information on using import, DirectQuery, or composite models.

# Implement data modeling best practices

There are some basic principles to abide by when building any data model. These principles become even more important as data begins to grow.

Most importantly, you want to do as much data preparation work as possible **before data reaches Power BI**, as far upstream as possible. For example, if you have the opportunity to transform data in the data warehouse, that's where it should be done. Transformation at the source produces consistency for any other solutions built on that data and ensures that your Power BI model doesn't need to do any extra processing. This may require working with your data engineer or other members of the data team and is critically important.

### 
# Best practices for import mode:

- Always **start with import mode** if you can.
- **Only bring in data you need**.
	- Remove unnecessary rows and columns.
	- Only process what is absolutely necessary (tables/partitions) given the business requirements.
- **Avoid wide tables**.
	- Use a [star schema](/en-us/power-bi/guidance/star-schema) in Power BI.
		- If your source is a beautifully modeled data warehouse, you're a step ahead.
		- Big data is often in wide flat tables. Take advantage of dimensional models for their performance benefits.
		- Power BI supports multiple fact tables with different dimensionality and different granularities â you donât have to put everything into one large table.
- **Pre-aggregate data before loading it to the model** where possible.
- **Reduce the usage of calculated columns.**
	- Data transformations requiring additional columns should be done as close to the source as possible.
- **Avoid high cardinality columns**.
	- Consider breaking a datetime column into two columns, one for date and one for time.
- **Use appropriate data types**.
	- Use integers instead of strings for ID columns.
	- Use surrogate keys for ID columns if necessary.
- **Limit the use of bi-directional filters** on relationships.
- **Disable [auto date/time](/en-us/power-bi/guidance/auto-date-time)**.
	- Connect to a date table at the source or create your own date table.
- Disable attribute hierarchies for non-attribute columns.
- If querying a relational database, **query database views rather than tables**.
	- A view provides an abstraction layer to manage columns, and relates back to the first consideration, pushing transformations as close to the source as possible.
	- Views shouldn't contain logic. They should only contain a SELECT statement from a table.
- **Consider partitioning and incremental refresh** to avoid loading data you donât need to.
- Check to **ensure [query folding](/en-us/power-query/power-query-folding) is achieved**.
	- If query folding isn't possible, you have another opportunity to work with the data engineer to move transformation upstream.

### 
# Best practices specific to DirectQuery mode:

- Set relationships to enforce integrity using the **[Assume referential integrity property](/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-assume-referential-integrity)** on relationships.
	- The Assume Referential Integrity setting on relationships enables queries to use INNER JOIN statements rather than OUTER JOIN.
- **Limit the use of bi-directional filters** on relationships.
	- Use only when necessary.
- Limit the **complexity of DAX calculations**.
	- Because query folding occurs by default in DirectQuery, more complex DAX measures means added complexity at the source, leading to slow queries.
	- The need for complex DAX also leads back to the key principle of applying transformations as far upstream as possible. You may need to work with the data engineer to apply transformations at the source.
- **Avoid the use of calculated columns.**
	- Transformations requiring additional columns should be done as far upstream as possible, particularly when using DirectQuery.
- **Avoid relationships on calculated columns**
- **Avoid relationships on Unique Identifier columns**
- Use **dual storage mode** for dimensions related to fact tables that are in DirectQuery.

Note

Refer to the [DirectQuery model guidance](/en-us/power-bi/guidance/directquery-model-guidance) for a complete list of considerations in developing DirectQuery models.

There's also a tool you can use as you're developing tabular models that will alert you of modeling missteps or changes that would improve model design and performance. The [Best Practice Analyzer within Tabular Editor](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/best-practice-rules-to-improve-your-models-performance/) was designed to help you design models that adhere to modeling best practices.
