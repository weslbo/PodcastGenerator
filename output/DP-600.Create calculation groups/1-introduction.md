# Introduction

Designing Power BI reports to meet the needs of users can be a challenge, requiring many different calculations and the ability to evaluate each of those calculations in multiple time periods.

For example, the sales manager at Contoso wants to understand sales trends for the year. They've asked you to create multiple measures (orders, sales, and profit) for several time slices, such as month to date, quarter to date, year to date, and previous year. After jumping in and starting to create measures for each metric for each time slice, you realize what a large amount of work this is going to be! Calculation groups are the best way to achieve this kind of a task without increasing the modelâs complexity.
