So Emma, now that we know how to enable Microsoft Fabric, how can we check if we have access to it in our organization's tenant?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Great question, Brian. To check if you have access to Fabric, simply sign in to Power BI and look for the Power BI icon in the bottom left corner of the navigation pane. If you see the icon, you can select it to explore the experiences available within Fabric. If the icon is not present, it means that Fabric is not available to you.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's helpful, Emma. But what if I'm not sure if Fabric is available to me? Is there someone I can contact to find out?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Absolutely, Brian. If you're unsure about Fabric availability, you can reach out to your Fabric administrator. They will be able to provide you with the necessary information. It's always a good idea to check with them if you have any doubts.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
Got it, Emma. Now, let's say I have admin privileges. How can I enable Fabric for my organization?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
If you have admin privileges, you can access the Admin center by clicking on the Settings menu in the upper right corner of the Power BI service. From there, you can enable Fabric in the Tenant settings. You have the option to make Fabric available either for the entire organization or specific groups of users based on their security groups.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That sounds straightforward, Emma. And what if I want to create Fabric enabled workspaces?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
To create Fabric enabled workspaces, you need to ensure that the workspaces are in Premium capacity. If you don't have access to Premium capacity, you won't be able to use Fabric. You can enable Premium capacity for your workspace by selecting "Trial" in the Premium capacity settings section of the Workspace settings page.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
I see, Emma. So once I have my Fabric enabled workspace, how can I start creating resources in Fabric?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Once you have your Fabric enabled workspace, you can start creating resources by using the Create menu in the upper left corner of the Power BI service. From there, you'll have access to various options to create resources within Fabric.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's great, Emma. Lastly, can you tell me more about the different Fabric experiences?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Of course, Brian. Fabric experiences refer to the different capabilities included in Fabric. You can switch between experiences using the experience switcher located in the bottom left corner of the navigation pane. Fabric experiences include Data engineering, Data factory, Data science, Data warehousing, real-time analytics, and Power BI. It's worth noting that Fabric brings together capabilities from Power BI, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, and Azure Machine Learning in a single, integrated experience.

<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
Thank you for explaining that, Emma. I'm really excited to explore Fabric and its various capabilities.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
You're welcome, Brian. I'm sure you'll find Fabric to be a powerful tool for implementing analytics solutions. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.
