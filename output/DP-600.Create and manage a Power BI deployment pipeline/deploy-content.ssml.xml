So Emma, I've been reading about deploying content in Power BI and I wanted to learn more about it. Can you explain how the deployment process works?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Sure, Brian. The deployment process in Power BI allows you to clone content from one stage in the pipeline to another, such as from development to test, and from test to production. During deployment, Power BI copies the content from the current stage to the target stage while maintaining the connections between the items.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That sounds useful. Can you give me an example of how this works in a real-world scenario?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Of course. Let's say you have a report that is bound to a dataset in the development stage. When you deploy the content to the test stage, Power BI will clone both the report and the dataset and ensure that they are still connected in the target workspace.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That makes sense. So, if I want to deploy all the content from one stage to another, how can I do that?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
To deploy all the content from one stage to another, you can simply select the stage you want to deploy from and click on the deployment button. Power BI will then copy all the workspace content into the target stage, including all the existing content in the current stage.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
Okay, got it. But what if I only want to deploy specific items and not everything in the workspace?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
If you want to deploy only specific items, you can click on the "Show more" link and then select the items you wish to deploy. When you click the deploy button, only the selected items will be deployed to the next stage.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's helpful. And what about the dependencies between items? How does Power BI handle that during deployment?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Power BI takes care of the dependencies between items during deployment. For example, if you want to deploy a report, clicking the "select related" button will automatically mark the dataset that the report is connected to. This ensures that both the report and the dataset are deployed together, preventing any breakage.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
Ah, I see. So, what happens if the items that an item is dependent on don't exist in the target stage?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
If the items that an item is dependent on don't exist in the target stage, you won't be able to deploy it. For example, if you try to deploy a report without its dataset, it will fail unless the dataset already exists in the target stage.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's good to know. It's important to make sure all the necessary dependencies are in place before deploying. Thanks for explaining the deployment process, Emma.

You're welcome, Brian. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
