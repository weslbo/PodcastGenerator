# Introduction

Organizations are increasingly employing analytics as a core part of their routines â business decision makers rely on information and insights to inform and take action, making analytics essential to an organization's success. With increasing consumption, users also demand more from their analytics â more information in a single report, new and easier ways to answer questions, as well as fresh, reliable, and constantly updated data. As a result, Power BI creators and developers must deliver updates faster, while maintaining excellent quality to ensure end-users will maintain trust in the data.
