Of course, Brian. As you mentioned, I work for Contoso and specialize in implementing analytics solutions using Microsoft Fabric. Today, we'll be focusing on how to create and connect to core and specialized datasets, explore dataset relationships, and connect and manage datasets through the XMLA endpoint. These are important aspects of building efficient and flexible analytics solutions using Microsoft Fabric.
