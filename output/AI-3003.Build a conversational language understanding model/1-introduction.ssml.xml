Natural language processing is a common AI problem where software needs to understand and work with text or speech in the way humans communicate. Within this field, natural language understanding plays a crucial role in determining the semantic meaning of the language. Today, we'll explore how Azure AI Language can help us build powerful natural language understanding solutions. So, Emma, could you tell us more about Azure AI Language and how it can be used for natural language understanding?
