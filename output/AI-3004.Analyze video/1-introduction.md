# Introduction

It's increasingly common for organizations and individuals to generate content in video format. For example, you might use a cellphone to capture a live event, or you might record a teleconference that combines webcam footage and presentation of slides or documents. As a result, a great deal of information is encapsulated in video files, and you may need to extract this information for analysis or to support indexing for searchability.

In this module, you will learn how to use the **Azure Video Indexer** service to analyze videos.

After completing this module, youâll be able to:

- Describe Azure Video Indexer capabilities.
- Extract custom insights.
- Use Azure Video Indexer widgets and APIs.
