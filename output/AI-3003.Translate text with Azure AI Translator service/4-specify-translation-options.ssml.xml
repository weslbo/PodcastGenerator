<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
Emma, can you explain how the Translate function of the API handles word alignment?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Sure, Brian. When translating text from one language to another, word alignment is important to understand the relationship between the words in the source text and the translation. By setting the includeAlignment parameter to true, you can see the alignment between characters in the source and the translation.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's interesting, Emma. Can you give me an example of how word alignment works?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Of course, Brian. Let's say we have the English phrase "Smart Services" and we want to translate it to Simplified Chinese. Without word alignment, the translation would be "æºè½æå¡", which is difficult to understand. But by including alignment, we can see that characters 0 to 4 in the source correspond to characters 0 to 1 in the translation, and characters 6 to 13 in the source correspond to characters 2 to 3 in the translation.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
I see, Emma. So including alignment helps us understand the mapping between the source and translation. What other options can we specify when using the Translate function?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Another useful option is includeSentenceLength. By setting this parameter to true, we can get the length of the translation. This can be helpful for determining how to display the translation in a user interface.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That makes sense, Emma. Can you give me an example of how includeSentenceLength works?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Certainly, Brian. Let's say we want to translate the English phrase "Hello world" to French. By including sentence length, we can see that the translation has a length of 11 characters.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
I see, Emma. Including sentence length can help us determine how to display the translation. Are there any other options we can specify?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Yes, Brian. Another option is profanity filtering. Sometimes text contains profanities that we might want to obscure or omit in the translation. We can handle profanities by specifying the profanityAction parameter. It can have values like NoAction, Deleted, or Marked.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's interesting, Emma. Can you give me an example of how profanity filtering works?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Certainly, Brian. Let's say we have the English text "JSON is fucking great!" and we want to translate it to German. By setting the profanityAction to Marked and profanityMarker to Asterisk, the profanity will be replaced with asterisks in the translation.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
I see, Emma. Profanity filtering can be useful to handle inappropriate language in translations. Thank you for explaining these translation options.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
You're welcome, Brian.
