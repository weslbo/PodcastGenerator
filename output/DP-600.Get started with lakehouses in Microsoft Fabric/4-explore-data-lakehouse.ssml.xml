So Emma, now that we have loaded the data into the lakehouse, what are some of the tools and techniques we can use to explore and transform it?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Great question, Brian! We have a few options available to us. One of the main tools we can use is Apache Spark. With Spark, we can leverage Notebooks or Spark Job Definitions to process data in the lakehouse using Scala, PySpark, or Spark SQL.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That sounds interesting, Emma. Can you explain a bit more about Notebooks and Spark Job Definitions?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Absolutely, Brian. Notebooks are interactive coding interfaces where we can write code to read, transform, and write data directly to the lakehouse as tables and/or files. It allows for a more hands-on approach to exploring and transforming the data.

On the other hand, Spark Job Definitions are scripts that can be executed on-demand or scheduled. These scripts use the Spark engine to process data in the lakehouse. They are great for automating data transformation tasks.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
I see. So we have the flexibility to choose between a more interactive approach with Notebooks or a more automated approach with Spark Job Definitions. That's helpful. Are there any other tools we can use?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Yes, Brian. Another tool we have is the SQL analytic endpoint. Each lakehouse includes a SQL analytic endpoint that allows us to run Transact-SQL statements to query, filter, aggregate, and explore data in the lakehouse tables. It provides a familiar SQL interface for data analysis.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's convenient. So we can use SQL to perform various data analysis tasks directly on the lakehouse tables. What else can we do?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
We also have the option to use Dataflows. With Dataflows, we can not only ingest data into the lakehouse but also perform subsequent transformations using Power Query. We can even land the transformed data back into the lakehouse if needed.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's interesting. So Dataflows provide us with a way to perform transformations using Power Query and maintain the transformed data within the lakehouse. Is there anything else we should know?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Yes, Brian. We can also use data pipelines to orchestrate complex data transformation logic. Data pipelines allow us to sequence activities such as dataflows, Spark jobs, and other control flow logic. This helps us automate and streamline our data transformation processes.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's fantastic, Emma. We have a variety of tools and techniques at our disposal to explore and transform the data in the lakehouse. It's great to have such flexibility. Thank you for sharing all this information with us.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
You're welcome, Brian. I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
Will do, Emma. Thanks again for being here and sharing your expertise. And thank you to our listeners for tuning in. Keep exploring and implementing analytics solutions using Microsoft Fabric. Until next time!
