Thank you, Emma, for joining us today. Now, let's jump right into the topic. Today, we'll be exploring the world of implementing analytics solutions using Microsoft Fabric. We'll learn about data warehouses in Fabric, how to create a data warehouse, load data into it, query the data, and even visualize it. So, Emma, could you please give us an overview of what a data warehouse is in the context of Microsoft Fabric?

A data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric is a modern version of the traditional data warehouse. It serves as a centralized and organized repository for data from different departments, systems, and databases. The data warehouse provides a unified view of the data, making it easier for analysis and reporting purposes. What sets Fabric's data warehouse apart is that it's built on the Lakehouse architecture, stored in Delta format, and can be queried using SQL. It's designed to be used by the entire data team, not just data engineers.
