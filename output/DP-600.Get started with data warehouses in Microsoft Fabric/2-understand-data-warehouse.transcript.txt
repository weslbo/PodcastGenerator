[Brian]: So Emma, now that we understand the fundamentals of a data warehouse, let's talk about Fabric's data warehouse experience. Can you explain what makes Fabric's data warehouse unique?

[Emma]: Absolutely, Brian. Fabric's data warehouse is a fully managed, scalable, and highly available relational data warehouse. It supports the full transactional T-SQL capabilities that you would expect from an enterprise data warehouse. This means that you have complete control over creating tables, loading data, transforming data, and querying data using either the Fabric portal or T-SQL commands. You can also use SQL to analyze the data or use Spark to process the data and create machine learning models.

[Brian]: That sounds great, Emma. So with Fabric's data warehouse, data engineers and data analysts can work together in the same experience. How does that collaboration work?

[Emma]: Excellent question, Brian. In Fabric, data engineers build a relational layer on top of the data in the Lakehouse. This layer consists of tables that are optimized for multidimensional modeling. Data analysts can then use T-SQL and Power BI to explore and analyze the data. This collaboration between data engineers and data analysts allows for a seamless workflow and ensures that both teams can work together effectively.

[Brian]: That's really helpful, Emma. Now, let's dive a bit deeper into the design of a data warehouse. Can you explain how tables are organized in a data warehouse and what is dimensional modeling?

[Emma]: Of course, Brian. In a data warehouse, tables are typically organized using dimensional modeling. This involves structuring tables into fact tables and dimension tables. Fact tables contain the numerical data that you want to analyze, such as the total amount paid for sales orders. Dimension tables, on the other hand, contain descriptive information about the data in the fact tables, like information about the customers who placed the sales orders. This organization allows for efficient and effective analysis of large amounts of data.

[Brian]: That makes sense, Emma. So within a dimension table, what are the different types of columns that we typically find?

[Emma]: Within a dimension table, you will typically find attribute columns, which provide descriptive information about the data. Additionally, a dimension table contains a unique key column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. This key column can be a surrogate key, which is a unique identifier generated by the database management system, or an alternate key, which is a natural or business key from the source system. Both surrogate and alternate keys serve different purposes in maintaining consistency and traceability in the data warehouse.

[Brian]: Thanks for explaining that, Emma. Are there any special types of dimension tables that provide additional context for data analysis?

[Emma]: Absolutely, Brian. Two special types of dimension tables are time dimensions and slowly changing dimensions. Time dimensions provide information about the time period in which an event occurred, allowing data analysts to aggregate data over temporal intervals. Slowly changing dimensions, on the other hand, track changes to dimension attributes over time, such as changes to a customer's address or a product's price. These special types of dimensions enable more comprehensive data analysis and ensure that the data stays up-to-date and accurate.

[Brian]: That's really interesting, Emma. Finally, can you explain the different schema designs that are commonly used in data warehouses?

[Emma]: Certainly, Brian. The most common schema design in a data warehouse is the star schema. In a star schema, a fact table is directly related to dimension tables, forming a star shape. This design allows for easy querying and analysis of data at different levels of granularity. Another schema design is the snowflake schema, where dimension tables are normalized and split into separate tables. This design is useful when there are lots of levels or shared information between different entities. Both schema designs have their advantages and can be used based on the specific requirements of the data warehouse.

[Brian]: Thank you for explaining that, Emma. I now have a better understanding of how data warehouses are designed and how Fabric's data warehouse experience can facilitate collaboration between data engineers and data analysts.
