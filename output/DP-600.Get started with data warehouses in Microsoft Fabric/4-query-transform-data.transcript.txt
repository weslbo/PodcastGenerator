[Brian]: So Emma, now that we have our data warehouse set up in Fabric, how can we query and transform the data for analytics purposes?

[Emma]: There are two ways to query data from your data warehouse in Fabric. The first option is to use the SQL query editor, which provides a familiar T-SQL query experience with features like intellisense, code completion, and syntax highlighting. You can create tables, views, and stored procedures using this editor. 

[Brian]: That sounds great! Can you give me an example of how we can use the SQL query editor?

[Emma]: Sure! Let's say we want to create a new view for analysts to use in Power BI reporting. We can use the SQL query editor to write a T-SQL query that creates the view. Here's an example:

[Brian]: That looks straightforward. What about the second option for querying data?

[Emma]: The second option is the Visual query editor. It provides a drag-and-drop experience similar to the Power Query online diagram view. You can create a new query by clicking on the "New visual query" button. From there, you can drag tables from your data warehouse onto the canvas and use the Transform menu to add columns, filters, and other transformations to your query. 

[Brian]: That's interesting. Can you show me an example of how the Visual query editor looks like?

[Emma]: Absolutely! Here's a screenshot of the Visual Query Editor:

[Brian]: Wow, that looks user-friendly. So, with the Visual query editor, we can easily perform transformations on our data without writing complex queries, right?

[Emma]: Exactly! The Visual query editor simplifies the process of adding columns, filters, and other transformations to your query. It's a great option for users who prefer a more visual and intuitive approach to querying and transforming data.

[Brian]: That's fantastic! And can we connect to the SQL analytics endpoint from any tool?

[Emma]: Yes, you can connect to the SQL analytics endpoint from any tool that supports SQL connections. This allows you to query and analyze your data using your preferred tools and workflows.

[Brian]: That's really convenient. Thank you for explaining the different ways we can query and transform data in Fabric, Emma.

[Emma]: You're welcome, Brian. I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
