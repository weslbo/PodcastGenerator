# Introduction

You can enforce model security by restricting access to subset of data, and by restricting access to specific model tables and columns. You might restrict access because some report consumers arenât permitted to view specific data, like sales results of other sales regions. Achieving this requirement commonly involves setting up row-level security (RLS), which involves defining roles and rules in that filter data model. You can also set up object-level security (OLS), to restrict access to entire tables or columns.

# Learning objectives

By the end of this module, youâll be able to:

- Restrict access to Power BI model data with RLS.
- Restrict access to Power BI model objects with OLS.
- Apply good development practices to enforce Power BI model security.
