# Apply good modeling practices

Itâs critical that your model enforces data permissions correctly and efficiently. The following list provides you with good development practices to apply.

- Strive to define fewer datasets (data models) with well-designed roles.
- Strive to create fewer roles by using dynamic rules. A data-driven solution is easier to maintain because you donât need to add new roles.
- When possible, create rules that filter dimension tables instead of fact tables. It will help to deliver faster query performance.
- Validate that the model design, including its relationships and relationship properties, are correctly set up.
- Use the function instead of function. It provides consistency when validating the roles in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.
- Rigorously validate RLS and OLS by testing all roles.
- Ensure that the Power BI Desktop data source connection uses the same credentials that will be applied when set up in the Power BI service.
