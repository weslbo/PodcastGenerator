[Brian]: Welcome back again, listeners! In the next couple of minutes, we're going to talk about preparing data for analysis and reporting. Andrew, let's dive in immediately by asking you the following question: How do we build relationships between tables in a data model?

[Andrew]: Great question, Brian! Building relationships is a crucial step in creating a data model. In Fabric, you can easily connect tables in the data model by using the click-and-drag interface in the Model view. This allows you to establish relationships between a fact table and dimension tables. By doing so, you can analyze data across multiple tables and gain valuable insights.

[Brian]: That sounds really convenient, Andrew. So, once we have the relationships set up, how do we create measures in the data model?

[Andrew]: Another excellent question, Brian! Measures are the metrics that we want to analyze in our data warehouse. In Fabric, we can create measures by using the New measure button in the Model view. Measures are calculated fields that are based on the data in the tables using the Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula language. This allows us to perform calculations and derive meaningful insights from our data.

[Brian]: I see. So, when we have a lot of fields in our data model, is there a way to simplify things for report builders?

[Andrew]: Absolutely, Brian! To simplify the data model for report builders, we can hide elements from view. This can be done by right-clicking on a table or column and selecting Hide. Hiding fields removes them from the model view, but they will still be available for use in the dataset. This way, we can streamline the data model and make it easier for report builders to navigate and work with.

[Brian]: That's a great feature, Andrew. Now, let's talk about datasets. Can you explain what they are and how they are used in Fabric?

[Andrew]: Of course, Brian! Datasets in Fabric are semantic models with metrics that are used to create reports. They are created automatically when a data warehouse is created in Fabric. Analysts and business users can connect to these datasets for reporting purposes. The datasets are kept in sync with the data warehouse, so there's no need to worry about maintaining them. Additionally, custom datasets can be created to meet specific needs.

[Brian]: That's really convenient, Andrew. And what about the default dataset? How does that work?

[Andrew]: Ah, the default dataset. It's automatically created for you in Fabric, Brian. It inherits business logic from the parent lakehouse or warehouse and serves as the foundation for downstream analytics and business intelligence. New tables in the Lakehouse are automatically added to the default dataset, but users can also manually select tables or views from the warehouse to include in the model for more flexibility. The objects in the default dataset are created as a layout in the model view.

[Brian]: That's fascinating, Andrew. Finally, let's talk about visualizing data. How can we do that in Fabric?

[Andrew]: Visualizing data in Fabric is a breeze, Brian. You can easily visualize the results of a single query or your entire data warehouse without leaving the data warehouse experience. Fabric allows you to explore data while you work, ensuring that you have all the necessary data and transformations for your analysis. You can create a new Power BI report from the contents of your entire data warehouse by using the New report button. This opens the Power BI service experience where you can build and save your report for use by the business.

[Brian]: That's fantastic, Andrew! Thank you for sharing your expertise on preparing data for analysis and reporting. After the break, we will continue with the next topic!
