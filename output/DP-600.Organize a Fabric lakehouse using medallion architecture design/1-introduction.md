# Introduction

In this data-driven era, the need to harness vast and diverse data sources is critical for business success. The [Fabric lakehouse](/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/lakehouse-overview), blending data lakes and data warehouses, offers an ideal platform to manage and analyze this data. The medallion architecture has become a standard across the industry for lakehouse-based analytics.

The medallion architecture brings structure and efficiency to your lakehouse environment. This module guides you through its bronze, silver, and gold layers, ensuring you know how to organize, refine, and curate data effectively.

Whether you're a seasoned data engineer or an analytics newcomer, this module caters to all levels of experience with practical examples and a hands-on exercise. You should be familiar with the Fabric data lakehouse and have a basic understanding of SQL and Power BI before you begin. Check out the [Get started with Lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric](/en-us/training/modules/get-started-lakehouses/) module to learn more.

In this module, you'll explore and build a medallion architecture for Fabric lakehouses, query and report on data in your Fabric lakehouse, and describe best practices for security and governance of your Fabric lakehouse.
