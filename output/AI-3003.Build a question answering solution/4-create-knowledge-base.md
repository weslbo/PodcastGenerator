# Create a knowledge base

To create a question answering solution, you can use the REST API or SDK to write code that defines, trains, and publishes the knowledge base. However, it's more common to use the [Language Studio](https://language.azure.com) web interface to define and manage a knowledge base.

To create a knowledge base you:

1. - Sign in to Azure portal.
2. - Search for Azure AI services using the search field at the top of the portal.
3. - Select Create under the Language Service resource.
4. - Create a resource in your Azure subscription:

Enable the question answering feature.
Create or select an Azure AI Search resource to host the knowledge base index.
5. - In Language Studio, select your Azure AI Language resource and create a Custom question answering project.
6. - Add one or more data sources to populate the knowledge base:

URLs for web pages containing FAQs.
Files containing structured text from which questions and answers can be derived.
Predefined chit-chat datasets that include common conversational questions and responses in a specified style.
7. - Edit question and answer pairs in the portal.
