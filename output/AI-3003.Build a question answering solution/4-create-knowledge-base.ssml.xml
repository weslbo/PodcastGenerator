So Emma, once we have created a knowledge base, what are the next steps in developing a natural language processing solution with Azure AI Services?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
After creating the knowledge base, the next step is to define and train the question answering model. This can be done using the Language Studio web interface. You can add question and answer pairs to the knowledge base, and the model will learn from them to provide accurate responses.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That sounds great! Can you give me an example of how this would work in a real-world scenario?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Sure! Let's say you have a customer support website with a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page. You can use the URLs of those web pages as data sources to populate the knowledge base. The model will then learn from the question and answer pairs in the FAQ to provide accurate responses to customer queries.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's really helpful. What other types of data sources can we use to populate the knowledge base?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
In addition to web pages, you can also use files containing structured text. These files can be in various formats such as JSON, CSV, or plain text. The model will extract question and answer pairs from these files to learn from.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's interesting. Can we also use predefined chit-chat datasets?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
Absolutely! Predefined chit-chat datasets are a great way to add conversational questions and responses to the knowledge base. These datasets include common conversational questions and responses in a specified style, which can enhance the natural language processing capabilities of the model.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's really cool. So once we have defined and trained the question answering model, what's the next step?
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
The next step is to publish the knowledge base and make it available for querying. You can do this through the Language Studio web interface. Once published, you can use the REST API or SDK to integrate the question answering capability into your applications.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-BrianNeural">
That's fantastic. It seems like Azure AI Services provide a comprehensive solution for developing natural language processing solutions. Thank you for sharing these insights, Emma.
</voice>
<voice name="en-US-EmmaNeural">
You're welcome, Brian.
